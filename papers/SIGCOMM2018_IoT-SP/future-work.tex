\begin{itemize}
\item Machine learning to speed up / automate traffic pattern detection.
\item Call for encryption techniques that pads packets so that all packets are of same length (e.g. MSS) or randomizes packet lengths? However, full length of conversation (even with padding/randomization) may still expose some information.
\end{itemize}
