First, it lets us uncover commonalities in the design (of the network protocols) of smart plugs across vendors.
Second, it allows us to compare the security and privacy of the different smart plugs with the ultimate goal of providing a recommendation to end users who are concerned with these aspects.

For each smart plug, we perform the following set of actions... For each action, we note the time...
