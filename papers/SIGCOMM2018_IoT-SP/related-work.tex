Princeton paper:
\begin{itemize}
\item Recognize that they can perform activity detection by observing changes in traffic volume over time
\item However, they cannot distinguish on/off from each other
\item Proposed traffic shaping does not prevent activity inference from the observation of packet lengths in specific sequences (assuming no VPN)
\end{itemize}
Cisco paper:
\begin{itemize}
\item Also uses DNS for contextual information
\item Refers to previous work that considers packet lengths and sequences of packets (and uses this themselves)
\end{itemize}
